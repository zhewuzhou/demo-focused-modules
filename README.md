Key points to make maintainable Terraform code:
1. With Terrform one should create focused module that has single responsibility. 
2. Comprehensive testing
   1. Unit testing of each module
   2. Integration testing of the whole infrastructure
   3. Configuration testing to verify that the infrastructure is configured as expected
